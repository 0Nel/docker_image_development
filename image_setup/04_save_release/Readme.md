# Release Export

If you want to deploy the release to others, you may use the `build.bash` to create an export containing everything that is needed.

Steps:

* Fill the `Readme_scritps.md` with usage instructions.
* Run the script. It creates two .tar.gz files: one containing the image and the other containing the scripts.
* Provide the archive files, extract, setup Docker, run the scripts from the image.
