### Docker CE

If Docker is already installed from the standard Ubuntu repositories you need to uninstall this version first.

Then you can install the latest Docker version as described here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

These are the most common steps:

1. Install curl (if not already done)
```bash
$ sudo apt install curl
```
1. Install the docker repository key: 
```bash
$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```
3. Install the repository:
```bash
$ sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
```
4. Update repositories and install docker_ce:
```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install docker-ce
```
5. Add your user to the docker group:

In order to be able to run docker commands without being root, you should add your user to the `docker` group (new login required to take effect).
```bash
$ sudo adduser $(id -un) docker
```

### NVIDIA Docker (2)

Then, you can proceed to install the NVIDIA Docker containers for 3d acceleration with access to (nvidia) graphics hardware.

Note: This requires to have the current NVIDIA driver installed, ubuntu is not updating major versions, check your 
package manager for the latest main package of the driver. When this document was written (30.11.2018) the latest version
in the standard ubuntu package repositories was: nvidia-driver-390. You can look for more recent drivers (higher numbers) via `apt search nvidia-driver-*`.

The following script (or each command by copying it to a terminal) can be used to install the nvidia docker images. Original Repo and installation instructions can be found
here: https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker

```bash
# Add the package repositories
distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID)
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/$distribution/nvidia-docker.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.list

sudo apt update && sudo apt install nvidia-container-toolkit
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

If successful, you should be able to reproduce this command and receive a similar output (also see [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker#usage)):

### Restart and convenience 

In order to make sure that the kernel modules are properly loaded, you should restart your computer. 

Now you are ready to use docker!

### Using DFKI registry
If you want to use the image generated by the docker build from this repository, you can also use the already build image from the DFKI registry server.

This has three prerequisites:
1. install the docker credential helper:
```bash
$ sudo apt install golang-docker-credential-helpers
```
(For ubuntu 16.04 and older this is not a package and has to be grabbed from https://github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers/releases, install the bin in /usr/bin using the one containing "secretservice" in it's name.)

2. Set up docker to use the credential helper:
Open the file ~/.docker/config.json (or create it if it doesn't exist), and put the following content in it:
```json
{
        "credsStore": "secretservice"
}
```
3. Now login to the DFKI registry server via (use your LDAP domain login, VPN required):
```bash
$ docker login d-reg.hb.dfki.de
```
Now you can pull images from the DFKI docker registry, e.g., by using the following statement in a Dockerfile:
```bash
FROM d-reg.hb.dfki.de/docker_development/plain_18.04:latest
```

You can use these images for example as the base image for the devel and release images, configured via `settings.sh` run via `./exec.bash`.
